## PROJECT OVERVIEW

BuildCore Infrastructure was awarded the contract to deliver 4.8km of twin tunnels as part of the Sydney Metro Northwest expansion. This project was critical to extending metro services through the Parramatta corridor, connecting major employment and residential precincts.

### Scope of Works

**Tunnel Construction:**
- 4.8km twin running tunnels (2 x 2.4km)
- Internal diameter: 6.5m
- Excavation method: Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM)
- Tunnel lining: Precast concrete segments

**Associated Infrastructure:**
- 2 emergency access shafts (depth: 35m)
- Cross-passages between tunnels (every 240m)
- Underground drainage and pumping systems
- Utilities diversions and protection works
- Temporary site compounds and access roads

**Systems Installation:**
- Track infrastructure and rail fastening systems
- Communications and signaling cable containment
- Power cable ducts and earthing systems
- Fire protection and ventilation integration points

## PROJECT CHALLENGES

### 1. Complex Urban Environment
**Challenge:** Tunneling beneath densely populated residential and commercial areas in Parramatta region, with strict limits on vibration, noise, and settlement.

**Solution:**
- Real-time settlement monitoring system with 180+ monitoring points
- Low-vibration TBM operation protocols
- 24/7 community hotline and dedicated liaison officers
- Pre-condition surveys of 450+ properties

**Outcome:** Zero property damage claims; average settlement: 8mm (limit: 15mm); community satisfaction: 92%

### 2. Ground Conditions
**Challenge:** Variable geology - transitioning between Ashfield Shale, Mittagong Formation sandstone, and localized weathered rock zones.

**Solution:**
- Geotechnical instrumentation program (50+ in-tunnel monitoring points)
- TBM face pressure optimization based on real-time data
- Ground improvement works (compensation grouting) at critical locations
- Engineering review panels for each geological transition

**Outcome:** TBM advance rates exceeded target (avg 18m/day vs 15m/day target)

### 3. Existing Infrastructure Interfaces
**Challenge:** Tunnels passed within 3m of existing Sydney Water trunk mains, electrical HV cables, and piled building foundations.

**Solution:**
- 3D clash detection modeling (BIM coordination)
- Real-time utility monitoring during breakthrough
- Protective ground freezing at critical utility crossings
- Staged construction approach near sensitive structures

**Outcome:** Zero utility strikes; zero service interruptions

### 4. COVID-19 Disruptions (2020)
**Challenge:** Pandemic restrictions impacted workforce availability, material supply chains, and site access protocols.

**Solution:**
- Workforce bubbles and enhanced hygiene protocols
- Accelerated tunneling program during Q2-Q3 2020 to recover schedule
- Material forward-ordering and increased on-site storage
- Remote client meetings and digital progress reporting

**Outcome:** Delivered 3 months ahead of original schedule despite COVID-19
