## PROJECT OVERVIEW

BuildCore Infrastructure delivered the underground station construction and fit-out works for the Brisbane Cross River Rail project. This transformative infrastructure project involved complex underground construction in the heart of Brisbane's CBD, requiring extensive coordination with existing services, adjacent developments, and continuous business operations.

### Scope of Works

- Excavation and construction of 2-level underground station box (45m depth)
- Station platform caverns (180m length x 18m width)
- Concourse level, station entrance, and egress structures
- Permanent ground support and waterproofing systems
- Station architectural finishes and fit-out

**Structural Works:**
- 15,000m³ mass concrete (base slabs and foundations)
- 3,200t reinforcing steel installation
- Precast concrete platform edge screens
- Structural steel station roof structure

**Services & Systems Integration:**
- Platform screen door systems
- Station HVAC, fire protection, and smoke extraction
- Communications and public information systems

## PROJECT CHALLENGES

### 1. CBD Location - Minimal Site Access
**Challenge:** Site located in dense CBD with single 20m wide access point, surrounded by operational high-rise buildings, pedestrian zones, and major roads.

**Solution:**
- Detailed logistics plan: all material deliveries scheduled outside peak hours (7pm-6am)
- Vertical access via gantry crane (120m height, 8t capacity)
- Just-in-time delivery to minimize on-site storage
- Digital logistics coordination platform (supplier integration)

**Outcome:** Zero traffic incidents; zero pedestrian disruptions; all deliveries on schedule

### 2. Existing Underground Services
**Challenge:** Over 80 major utilities within excavation zone - water, sewer, electrical HV cables, gas, telecommunications.

**Solution:**
- 3D BIM utility model (coordinated with 15 service providers)
- Phased utility relocation (18-month enabling works program)
- Live utility monitoring during excavation (24/7)
- Redundancy planning for critical services (emergency bypass systems)

**Outcome:** Zero utility strikes; 100% service continuity for CBD businesses

### 3. Groundwater Management
**Challenge:** Excavation below water table (12m below natural groundwater level) with high inflow potential (estimated 15L/sec).

**Solution:**
- Perimeter grout curtain injection (2,500 linear meters)
- Multi-stage dewatering system (deep wells + relief wells)
- Real-time piezometer monitoring (40+ monitoring points)
- Groundwater reinjection to maintain aquifer levels

**Outcome:** Inflow reduced to 3L/sec (80% reduction); zero impact on adjacent building settlements

### 4. Heritage & Archaeological Management
**Challenge:** Site within Brisbane CBD Heritage Precinct; potential for archaeological finds from 1800s settlement.

**Solution:**
- Archaeological watching brief (full-time archaeologist on-site)
- Heritage Impact Assessment and conservation protocols
- Collaboration with Queensland Museum and Heritage Council
- Excavation methodology adjusted for artifact discovery zones

**Outcome:** 450+ artifacts recovered and catalogued; heritage compliance 100%; public exhibition of findings

### 5. COVID-19 Pandemic (2021-2022)
**Challenge:** Two major lockdowns impacting workforce (30% reduction), material delays, and client approval processes.

**Solution:**
- Workforce bubbles (site-based accommodation for 80 workers)
- Digital approvals and remote inspections (client + certifiers)
- Material forward-ordering (3-month buffer stock)
- Program re-sequencing to optimize available workforce

**Outcome:** Delivered on original completion date despite 12 weeks lost to lockdowns
