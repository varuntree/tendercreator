# Project Context
## Multi-Document Tender Response Platform

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-04
**For:** Future AI sessions (context continuity)

---

## What We're Building

### The Problem
Current tender tools (TenderCreator.ai, AutogenAI) only generate **one document** per tender. Real tenders require **5-15+ different documents** (Technical Specs, Bill of Quantities, Risk Registers, Methodology, etc.).

### Our Solution
**Multi-document tender response platform** where AI:
1. Analyzes RFT documents
2. Identifies ALL required submission documents
3. Creates work packages for each document
4. Team works in parallel (or solo)
5. Each document follows proven workflow
6. Export complete tender package

**Innovation:** Real-world alignment - matches how tenders actually work.

---

## Why We're Building This

### Goal
**Win implementation contract** with TenderCreator.ai by:
- Building superior version as proof-of-concept
- Demonstrating multi-document capability (they don't have)
- Showing we can improve their product
- Proving technical execution ability

### Strategy
- **Not competitor** - positioning as contractor to enhance their product
- **MVP focus** - demo-grade to win contract, then get codebase access
- **Blow their minds** - feature they need but haven't built
- **Timeline:** 3-4 weeks solo + AI agents

---

## Key Constraints & Decisions

### Must Match TenderCreator UI
- Use their existing design (from docs.tendercreator.ai)
- Clean, card-based layouts
- Professional SaaS aesthetic
- **Why:** Show we understand their product + can enhance it

### Building On Existing Repo
- **Current repo:** Next.js 14 with marketing pages
- **Our task:** Build product features on top
- **Location:** `/app` directory (App Router)
- No marketing changes needed (already done)

### MVP Scope
- **Single-user functional** (can complete workflow solo)
- **Multi-user UI visible** (show team features, not functional)
- **Roles exist** (Admin/Writer/Reader) in data model + UI, single user in demo
- **Demo-grade** (not production-ready, proof-of-concept)

### Tech Stack (Locked In)
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, TipTap (editor)
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Storage + Auth)
- **AI:** Gemini 2.0 Flash ONLY (everywhere)
- **No RAG, no vector DB** - dump all context with smart batching (64K token limit)
- **Deployment:** Vercel

### AI Strategy
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash everywhere:**
  - Document identification
  - Content generation (with streaming support)
  - Editing assistance
  - Win themes + bid analysis (combined in single request)
  - Batch generation (2-3 docs per API call)
- **Why Gemini:**
  - 64K token context (sufficient for typical RFT + org docs)
  - Free tier (cost-effective for MVP)
  - Simple (no RAG complexity)
  - Fast enough for demo
  - Streaming support for real-time feedback
- **Context approach:**
  - Concatenate ALL org docs + ALL RFT docs
  - Validate context fits 64K token limit (js-tiktoken)
  - Cache assembled context (5 min TTL)
  - Smart batching: 2-3 docs per batch for bulk generation
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### What We're NOT Building (MVP)
- ✗ Email invitations (just UI mockups)
- ✗ Real team collaboration (single user, multi-user UI)
- ✗ Billing/subscriptions
- ✗ Mobile responsive (desktop demo only)
- ✗ Vector database / RAG
- ✗ Multiple AI models
- ✗ Advanced analytics
- ✗ Integrations (AusTender, Salesforce, etc.)

## Research Completed

### Location: `/ai_docs/`

**Competitor Research:**
- `tendercreator/` - Client (underperforming, Dec 2024 launch, no funding)
- `autogenai/` - Market leader ($87M, Salesforce-backed, enterprise)

**Key Files:**
- `01_product_features.md` - Feature analysis
- `02_technical_architecture.md` - Tech stack insights
- `03_market_strategy.md` - Market positioning

**Insights Used:**
- TenderCreator's 4-phase workflow (good UX pattern)
- AutogenAI's intelligent editor (AI text selection actions)
- Gap identified: Neither handles multi-document tenders
- UI reference: TenderCreator docs.tendercreator.ai

## Technical Notes

### Gemini Integration
```typescript
import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from '@google/generative-ai';

const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY);
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp' });

// Full context dump
const context = `
Organization Documents:
${orgDocs.map(d => d.content_text).join('\n\n')}

RFT Documents:
${rftDocs.map(d => d.content_text).join('\n\n')}

Requirements:
${requirements.map(r => r.text).join('\n')}
`;

const result = await model.generateContent({
  contents: [{ role: 'user', parts: [{ text: prompt + context }] }]
});
```

### Supabase Schema
```sql
-- Run migrations in order
-- See PRD for full schema
-- Key tables: organizations, users, organization_documents,
-- projects, project_documents, work_packages, work_package_content
```

### File Upload Flow
1. User uploads file → Supabase Storage
2. Get public URL
3. Extract text (Gemini File API or PDF parser)
4. Store text in `content_text` column
5. Ready for AI context

## Common Questions (Future You Might Ask)

### Q: Why Gemini 2.0 Flash instead of Claude?
**A:** Cost + free tier. Claude better quality but expensive for MVP. Gemini 2.0 Flash has 64K token context which is sufficient for typical tender documents with smart batching. Free tier adequate for demo.

### Q: Why no RAG?
**A:** MVP simplicity. With 64K token limit, we use smart batching (2-3 docs per request) and context caching. For single documents, RFT + org docs typically fit within 64K. For bulk generation, client-orchestrated batching splits work into manageable chunks. No need for vector DB complexity.

### Q: Why match TenderCreator UI?
**A:** We're pitching to enhance THEIR product. Showing we understand their design language proves we can integrate seamlessly.

### Q: Why single-user if showing team features?
**A:** Demo focus. Real multi-user = email invites, permissions, complex state. Not needed to prove concept. UI shows capability.

### Q: Can we add [feature X]?
**A:** Check PRD "Out of Scope" section. If not critical for demo, defer to post-contract.

### Q: What if Gemini analysis misses documents?
**A:** User validation step. Can manually add/remove documents. AI suggests, user confirms.

### Q: Export format?
**A:** Word (.docx) using docx.js library. Industry standard for tenders.

## For Future AI Sessions

**When resuming this project:**

1. **Read this file first** (CONTEXT.md)
2. **Review PRD** (`/ai_docs/PRD.md`)
3. **Check current phase** (ask user which phase we're on)
4. **Review existing code** (what's been built)
5. **Continue from there**

**Key Principles:**
- **Scope discipline** - MVP only, no feature creep
- **Match TenderCreator UI** - reference docs.tendercreator.ai
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash everywhere** - no other models
- **Simple context strategy** - dump all, no RAG
- **Demo quality** - functional > perfect

**Communication Style:**
- User prefers concise (sacrifices grammar for brevity)
- Focus on execution, not over-planning
- Ask critical questions, don't assume
- Acknowledge decisions clearly before building
