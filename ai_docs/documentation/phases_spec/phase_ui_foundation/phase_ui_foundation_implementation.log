## 2025-11-06 - Steps 12-22 Complete (E2E Testing & Fixes)

**Timestamp:** E2E testing and bug fixes completed

**Steps Completed:** Steps 12-22 (E2E test creation, execution, and iterative fixes)

**Summary:**
- E2E test file already existed at `.claude/commands/e2e/test_ui_foundation.md`
- Ran first E2E test iteration - captured 13 screenshots
- Identified issues:
  1. Console errors: Duplicate React keys (Home and Tenders both used `/projects` as key)
  2. Active state duplication: Both Home and Tenders showed active on /projects route
  3. Logo needed to match landing page logo (PNG image)
- Fixed duplicate key errors by adding unique `id` field to nav items
- Fixed active state logic to only show Home active when on /projects (not Tenders)
- Updated Company/Settings active state to handle nested routes properly
- Updated Logo component to use `/images/logo.png` (same as landing page)
- Auto-fixed ESLint import sorting errors
- Collapse/expand functionality verified working with localStorage persistence

**Files Changed:** 3 files
- Modified: components/sidebar.tsx (added IDs, fixed active state logic, fixed keys)
- Modified: components/logo.tsx (switched from Leaf icon to PNG logo image)
- Modified: components/navbar.tsx (auto-fixed imports)

**Test Results:**
- 13 screenshots captured in `test_results/ui_foundation/`
- Navbar renders correctly with home icon and avatar
- Sidebar renders with all 8 nav items and correct icons
- Collapse/expand functionality works smoothly
- State persists after page refresh
- User dropdown functional
