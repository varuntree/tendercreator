## Strategic Recommendations

### Critical (0-90 days)
1. **Social proof:** Publish pilot case studies, launch G2/Capterra, get testimonials
2. **Focus:** Narrow to 1 vertical (Government), defer others to Y2
3. **GTM:** Publish pricing, launch content, PR campaign, SEO foundation
4. **Differentiation:** Build AU govt tender database, win/loss analytics, framework templates
5. **Partnerships:** 2-3 consulting firms, MS365 integration, industry associations

### Priorities (3-6mo)
- Vertical-specific AI (govt compliance rules)
- Tender discovery/pipeline features
- Team collaboration/workflow
- AU govt framework content library
- Customer advisory board

### Long-term (6-12mo)
- Expand to 2nd vertical (Construction/IT)
- Network effects (tender outcome database)
- Govt framework agreements
- Strategic funding/partnership
- Platform ecosystem (APIs, marketplace)

## Assessment

### Strengths
- Modern tech stack, solid engineering
- AU hosting for govt market
- Strategic features (bid/no-bid, win themes)
- 4-phase workflow well-designed
- Documented 50-70% time savings

### Weaknesses
- **Market:** Late entry, BidWriteGPT advantage
- **Evidence:** Zero social proof, credibility gap
- **GTM:** Weak (no content, PR, pricing, reviews)
- **Resources:** Unfunded vs $87M+ competitors
- **Moat:** AU hosting temporary, no sustainable differentiation
- **Focus:** 4-industry dilution vs beachhead strategy

### Verdict
Solid product foundation, clear value prop, genuine market need. **Survival depends on:**
1. Rapid social proof generation (90 days)
2. Vertical focus (govt only)
3. GTM execution (content, pricing, partnerships)
4. Differentiation beyond hosting (AU-specific features)
5. Likely needs funding to compete vs well-funded rivals

**Risk:** Without urgent execution on above, BidWriteGPT captures AU market, globals expand, TenderCreator struggles to gain traction.
