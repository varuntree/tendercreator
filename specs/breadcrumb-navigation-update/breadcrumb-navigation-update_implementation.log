[Step 0] Start implementation at Fri Nov  7 10:08:18 UTC 2025
[Step 1] Reviewed breadcrumbs.tsx, navbar.tsx, project/work-package pages to document current breadcrumb + event usage.
[Step 2] Defined breadcrumb segment data contract and event plan for dynamic updates.
[Step 3] Implemented dynamic breadcrumb component with event-driven segments and fallback derivation.
[Step 4] Simplified navbar to rely solely on Breadcrumbs component—removed legacy project name event wiring.
[Step 5] Pages emit breadcrumb metadata: project detail + work package now dispatch structured segments using helper utilities.
[Step 6] Added fallback derivation in Breadcrumbs so routes render sensible trails while awaiting dynamic data.
[Step 7] Reviewed .claude/commands/test_e2e.md & test_basic_query.md, then authored .claude/commands/e2e/test_breadcrumb_navigation_update.md covering new breadcrumb flow.
---\nCHECKPOINT: Steps 1-7 complete (Breadcrumb architecture + docs).
[Step 8] Manually reviewed navigation flow to ensure breadcrumb events fire from project + document views; ready for lint validation.
[Validation] npm run lint ✅ | npm run test unavailable (missing script).
