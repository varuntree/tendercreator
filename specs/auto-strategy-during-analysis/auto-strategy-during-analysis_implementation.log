[Step 0] Start implementation at Fri Nov  7 10:15:36 UTC 2025
[Step 1] Reviewed analyze route + context assembly to understand current pipeline.
[Step 2] Outlined approach: reuse assembled context once per project, loop work packages, call generateStrategy, persist via saveCombinedGeneration with error handling.
[Step 3] Extended analyze API: assembles context once, generates strategy per work package, persists via saveCombinedGeneration, streams progress events.
[Step 4] Simplified StrategyGenerationScreen: removed Start Planning CTA, assume strategy data exists, kept regenerate + direct Generate Content.
[Step 5] Removed obsolete planning states and events; strategy screen now purely displays server-provided data.
[Step 7] Authored .claude/commands/e2e/test_auto_strategy_during_analysis.md after reviewing existing e2e guidelines.
---\nCHECKPOINT: Steps 1-7 complete (Backend + UI changes + docs).
[Validation] npm run lint ✅ | npm run test unavailable (script missing).
