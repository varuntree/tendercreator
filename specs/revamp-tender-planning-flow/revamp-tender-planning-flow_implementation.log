[Step 0] Starting implementation at Fri Nov  7 09:53:39 UTC 2025
[Step 1] Reviewed ai_docs/documentation/CONTEXT.md, PRD.md, and standards plus current strategy screen to extract design cues.
[Step 2] Verified work package page data flow already surfaces content + contentLoaded flags; ensured future CTA gating uses these without additional auto-generation hooks.
[Step 3] Rebuilt strategy-generation-screen layout: removed ProcessLoader/tabs, added hero section with manual CTA states.
[Step 4] Added explicit tender planning CTA flow: new Start Tender Planning button triggers /generate-strategy and gates Generate Content availability.
[Step 5] Implemented new Requirements Map card with mandatory/optional badges and refreshed list styling.
[Step 6] Created fresh Bid/No-Bid guidance section with recommendation banner, strengths/concerns lists, and criteria breakdown.
[Step 7] Redesigned Win Themes card with editable list, action buttons, and empty/loading states.
[Step 8] Implemented contextual loading/empty states plus status badges to cover pre-planning, in-progress, and ready scenarios.
[Step 9] Authored new E2E scenario at .claude/commands/e2e/test_revamp_tender_planning_flow.md after reviewing existing e2e guidelines.
---\nCHECKPOINT: Steps 1-9 complete (Design & Frontend refactor).
[Step 10] Manually reviewed component logic to ensure no automatic /generate-strategy call occurs and CTA states guard content generation.
[Step 11] Verified no additional documentation updates required beyond inline descriptions and new E2E script.
[Step 12] Validation: 'npm run lint' passed; 'npm run test' unavailable (no script). Documented missing script.
