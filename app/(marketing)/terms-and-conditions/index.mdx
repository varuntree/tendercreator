# Terms and Conditions

Welcome to TenderCreator. These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our AI-powered tender response automation platform, services, and website. By creating an account or using TenderCreator's services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use our services. These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you (individually or on behalf of your organization) and TenderCreator.

## 1. Service Description

TenderCreator provides an AI-powered platform designed to automate and streamline tender response creation for Australian businesses. Our services include intelligent RFT analysis, requirement extraction, smart compliance tracking, win strategy building, answer library management, pricing schedule assistance, evaluation score prediction, and professional document export capabilities. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of our services at any time with reasonable notice to users.

## 2. Account Registration and Use

To use TenderCreator, you must create an account by providing accurate, current, and complete information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You must be at least 18 years old and have the legal capacity to enter into binding contracts. If you are registering on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your account.

## 3. Acceptable Use

You agree to use TenderCreator services only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You must not use our platform to create fraudulent tender responses, misrepresent your organization's capabilities, violate any applicable laws or regulations, infringe upon intellectual property rights, transmit malicious code or viruses, attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems, or interfere with other users' access to the services. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these acceptable use provisions.

## 4. Data Ownership and Intellectual Property

You retain all ownership rights to your tender data, company information, and content uploaded to TenderCreator. By using our services, you grant us a limited license to process, store, and analyze your data solely for the purpose of providing our services to you. All intellectual property rights in the TenderCreator platform, software, AI models, and related materials remain the exclusive property of TenderCreator. Your commercial-in-confidence tender information is never used to train external AI models or shared with competitors.

## 5. Data Security and Australian Hosting

All data is hosted exclusively in Australian data centres with ISO 27001 certification and IRAP alignment. We implement bank-level encryption, role-based access controls, and continuous security monitoring to protect your information. While we take extensive measures to secure your data, you acknowledge that no system is completely secure and you use the service at your own risk. We comply with the Australian Privacy Principles and applicable data protection laws.

## 6. Subscription and Payment

TenderCreator offers subscription-based services with various pricing tiers. By subscribing, you agree to pay all applicable fees for your selected plan. Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled before the renewal date. All fees are non-refundable except as required by law. We reserve the right to change our pricing with at least 30 days notice to existing subscribers. Failure to pay fees may result in service suspension or account termination.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by Australian law, TenderCreator and its affiliates, officers, employees, and service providers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of or inability to use our services. Our total liability for any claims arising from these Terms or your use of TenderCreator shall not exceed the amount you paid to us in the 12 months preceding the claim. These limitations apply whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis.

## 8. Warranties and Disclaimers

TenderCreator services are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. While we strive to provide accurate AI-powered analysis and suggestions, we do not guarantee that our services will result in successful tender outcomes. You are solely responsible for reviewing, verifying, and finalizing all tender responses before submission. We do not warrant that our services will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure. You acknowledge that AI-generated content should be reviewed by qualified professionals before use in formal tender submissions.

## 9. Termination

You may terminate your account at any time through your dashboard settings. We may suspend or terminate your access to TenderCreator services immediately if you violate these Terms, fail to pay applicable fees, engage in fraudulent activity, or for any other reason with reasonable notice. Upon termination, you may export your data within 30 days, after which we will delete your account data in accordance with our Privacy Policy and data retention obligations.

## 10. Changes to Terms

We may modify these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in our services, legal requirements, or business practices. We will notify you of significant changes via email or through prominent notices on our platform at least 30 days before the changes take effect. Your continued use of TenderCreator after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms. If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop using our services and may terminate your account.

## 11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of Australia. Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of TenderCreator shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Australia. Before initiating formal legal proceedings, parties agree to attempt to resolve disputes through good faith negotiations.
